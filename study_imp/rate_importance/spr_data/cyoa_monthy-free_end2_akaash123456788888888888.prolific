story_text,Your alarm screams in your ear at 10 a.m., rudely disrupting a dream about your childhood golden retriever.,Groaning, you sit up and snatch your phone from the nightstand, pushing your knotted hair away from your face.,The alarm title flashes.,One month. Thirty days since Adam broke your heart and ran away with the pieces. Fantastic.,You let the beeping continue.,Turning away, you face-plant in a pile of crumpled tissues, damp with tears and snot from last nightâ€™s one-woman pity party.,You freeze. Something just touched your leg.,You scoot away quickly.,Peering across the bed, you eye Adamâ€™s stuffed bear.,How did your exâ€™s gift end up in your bed again?,You recall stashing it in your closet last night.,This relationship withdrawal is getting out of control.,Your gaze lands on the piano.,You pushed it to the dark corner of the room days after the breakup, trying to hide the sick reminder of the happy days when you and Adam played this piano together.,You glance back at your phone, biting your lip.,You should wash the dishes.,Rolling out of bed, you stumble to the kitchen.,You canâ€™t tell if youâ€™re hungry, nauseous or both.,You open the fridge.,You realize your mistake too late.,The Chinese takeout box from the night of the break-up stares back from the top shelf.,Exhaling, you retrieve the container of rice and open it.,Definitely expired.,You dump it in the trash can.,Life is miserable.,You need some positivity.,With this thought, you determinedly return to your bed.,Thereâ€™s only one thing left to do.,You need to call your best friend.,You press 1 on speed-dial.,Lex picks up on the first ring. â€œHappy monthiversary!â€,Ugh...this is not what you want to hear!,That this is the 30th day since your breakup does not make you feel any better. How frustrating!,â€œI don't like this conversation starter!â€,A soft click. Lex hangs up, but you know her too well to expect the conversation to end there.,Within seconds, your phone is ringing again.,Rolling your eyes, you answer. â€œYes?â€,Lex scoffs. You can picture her frowning through the phone.,â€œSorry to interrupt your busy schedule of sobbing and shoving junk food in your face.â€,You stroke the can of Pringles on your nightstand. â€œChips are friends. Not food.â€,â€œYouâ€™re the worst, and Iâ€™m the best. Iâ€™m taking you out. Now.â€,A car engine starts in the background. â€œBe over in five.â€,You hang up, crawling back under your covers and pulling the sheet over your head.,Five minutes later, you hear a dull thud across the room.,You sit up.,Another thud.,You throw the covers to the side, moving to the window to investigate.,A yellow blur flies through the air, smacking against the glass.,You peer down at the top of Lexâ€™s blonde head, which is covered in her trademark blue and pink highlights.,Poised to throw another yellow square at your window, she waves.,You slide your feet into a pair of fuzzy slippers and squint at the mirror by the door.,Your My Little Pony shirt from middle school isnâ€™t the most flattering.,Neither is your nest of uncombed hair or growing unibrow.,You should spice up the outfit.,Throwing on a pair of sunglasses, you glance back at the mirror.,Now youâ€™re fully dressed.,You run down two flights of stairs and push open the front door.,You approach Lex, who is lounging on the hood of her car.,You point at your building. â€œThat was vandalism.â€,Lex shrugs. â€œI had a feeling you werenâ€™t going to buzz me in.â€,You scoop up a yellow packet from the grass. â€œYou were throwing Peanut M&Mâ€™s at my window?â€,Lex tears open a packet and pops a few in her mouth. â€œHave a few. Consider it an incentive to avoid a 100-foot radius of he-who-shall-not-be-named.â€,Adam is deathly allergic to peanuts, so your diet has been practically Peanut M&M-free since you started dating.,Itâ€™s about time you tried one again.,Staring at the cartoon M&M characters, you canâ€™t curb your curiosity.,You open the packet, place an M&M on your tongue and let it melt.,Two years is a long time.,You forgot how great they tasted.,Lex stands, squinting at the sun. â€œCome on, Emily. Letâ€™s get you presentable.â€,With Lex behind, you trudge back up the stairs to your apartment.,Within moments, Lexâ€™s pierced nose is buried in your closet.,She extracts two dresses and throws them at you, raising an eyebrow.,You rub the skirt fabrics between your fingertips, exhaling.,What to wear to re-enter civilization?,The white dress might stain easily, but the red dress reminds you of Adam.,You pull the white dress over your head.,As you stare at the mirror, the blood drains from your face.,Hopefully you wonâ€™t be a klutz today, but who knows?,Your brain is anywhere but the present.,Lex cheers, grabbing her car keys. â€œYou know what I always say goes best with a pretty dress.â€,You wish you didnâ€™t.,Youâ€™d much rather take another nap with your can of Pringles than subject yourself to one of Lexâ€™s makeovers.,Her philosophy: put-together on the outside equals put-together on the inside.,Clearly, sheâ€™s not a math major.,Minutes later, she eases her foot off the gas pedal and parks in front of her favorite salon.,As you walk in, youâ€™re hit with the toxic fumes of nail polish and hairspray.,Rows of pastel-colored chairs line the walls.,A woman emerges from the back, wiping her hands on her apron.,She smiles. â€œHello, ladies. What can we do for you today?â€,You glance at the catalog on the counter. â€œUmâ€¦â€,You signal for Lex to choose.,Her eyes light up. Without hesitation, she points at the manicure.,Seems like the least permanent option.,No harm in making your nails a little shinier.,She directs you to the nail station and gestures for you to place your hands in a bowl of warm solution.,Lex holds a ring of sparkly green nails up to your face. â€œIâ€™m leaning toward Grass Green or Envy Forest.â€,You could fight back, but you donâ€™t have the energy. â€œUp to you.â€,Forty minutes later, you stare at your Grass Green nails.,Yep. Those would camouflage well with a lawn, minus the glitter.,Theyâ€™re even the same length as a blade of grass.,Lex tilts her head. â€œAre you sure you donâ€™t want to get your hair done?â€,You might as well.,You shrug. â€œWhat did you have in mind?â€,Lex claps, shoving a catalog beneath your nose.â€œI always thought youâ€™d look gorgeous with purple highlights.â€,You stand. â€œNever mind. Letâ€™s go.â€,Lex groans. â€œWhat? Are you sure? Would you feel better about pink?â€,â€œIâ€™m sure. Letâ€™s just grab coffee and head home.â€ Ignoring her pouting, you walk outside.,Birds chirp loudly in a nearby tree.,Racing clouds shift the shadows beneath your feet as you stare at the pavement.,Sitting on a park bench, you feel like the entire world is moving forward but youâ€™re stuck on the curb.,No amount of manicures or hair treatments could restart your life.,Lex emerges with a bubblegum lollipop.,You stand, sweeping a lock of hair behind your ear.,She makes a funny face at you.,You make one back. â€œWhat?â€,Lex touches your face. Her palm comes back baby blue.,You glance at your hand, which is also smeared blue, and then at your dress.,Oh, no. You sat on sidewalk chalk.,Lex gasps, staring at your stained dress. â€œEmilyâ€¦â€,You groan. â€œI know.â€,You should head to the cafe.,You squint.,â€œI just need a coffee.â€,As soon as you utter the words, something wet drops on your shoulder strap.,Lexâ€™s eyes bulge.,You glance up at the sky, making eye contact with the bird that just took a dump on your dress.,Itâ€™s a sign to head back inside.,Maybe buy a change of clothes.,Everyone goes to the coffee shop. You donâ€™t want to risk running into Adam in a stained dress covered in bird poop. Not that his opinion matters.,You and Lex head back into the mall and navigate to the intersection between a few stores.,Which would be the best option? Adamâ€™s favorite store or the one with the bad fashion display?,Bad fashion over anything Adam.,Time to start taking back your life.,You enter the store, appalled by the spread of beige.,Have these people ever heard of the primary colors, at the very least?,Perusing a bland string of skirts, you wonder if you would be better off in your gross dress.,You turn toward the entrance, contemplating a swift exit.,Your voice lowers to a whisper. â€œLex.â€,Her eyes lift from her phone and her jaw drops.,Standing twenty feet away is Adam.,He looks good. Normal. His hair is scruffy and his favorite red and black flannel hangs off his broad shoulders. Like the break-up never happened.,Lex touches your arm. â€œShould we leave?â€,That would be smart.,The only problem is the Adam-sized obstacle blockading you in the store.,You shuffle to the womenâ€™s side, hiding behind a clothing rack.,You peek through an opening between two hangers.,Adam appears to be shopping alone. Interesting.,Lex joins you and clears her throat. â€œOkay, Emily. As much as I love this new stalker energy you have going for you, are you going to say something to him or just creep from a distance?â€,You take a deep breath. â€œYouâ€™re right. Iâ€™ll talk to him.â€,You step out from behind the clothing rack. Pause. Heâ€™s gone.,Disappointment swells in your chest.,Lex gives you a side hug, resting her head on your shoulder. â€œLetâ€™s get you a cup of coffee.â€,Firefly CafÃ© is the go-to coffee spot near your college campus, and as you walk in, all five senses are entangled in its hazy ambiance.,The strong smells of coffee and chocolate mingle in the air.,Heat blasts from air vents framing the cafÃ©â€™s tiled walls, which are covered in portraits of coffee beans and animated customers.,The window seats are occupied by students with furrowed brows, headphones blasting as they hunch over textbooks.,Nothing has changed in your month-long boycott of the cafÃ©.,It was easier to forget Adam if you didnâ€™t have to sip coffee in the same shop where you first met.,Head buried in your purse, you take a couple of steps toward the coffee bar.,A loud voice sounds from your right. â€œExcuse me.â€,You look up to see a vaguely familiar face.,You recognize the guy from your Intro to Mass Communication class.,He gestures at a girl sitting in a booth. â€œWould you mind taking a photo for us?â€,Your brain goes into panic mode. Youâ€™re terrible at taking photos.,You hold out your palm.,He thrusts his phone into your hand. â€œThank you so much.â€,He lowers his voice. â€œInstead of taking a photo, can you hit the record button?â€,Easy enough. You nod, sliding to video mode and holding the screen up.,He pulls his drawstring bag off his shoulder and retrieves a ukulele, dropping to a knee in front of the girl.,Her eyes widen, hand covering her mouth.,All eyes in the cafe turn to the couple.,Strumming the opening to â€œMarry Meâ€ by Train, the guy sings until he gets to the end of the chorus.,At that point, the girl nods and throws her arms around his neck.,Looks like your break-upâ€™s monthiversary will be someone elseâ€™s anniversary.,The door jingles. You turn and see it inch open and shut as a little pug nudges it with its face.,Trapped outside, it looks up at you with sad eyes.,You glance at the couple and back at the pug.,Youâ€™re still recording. Should you let the dog in and risk messing up the video?,You decide against it.,Another customer enters. As the door opens, the dog shuffles inside and runs to the guy with the ukulele.,He reaches down and retrieves a ring from the pugâ€™s collar, then slides it onto his new fiancÃ©â€™s finger.,The coffee shop crowd cheers and claps.,After a few more seconds, you end the recording.,The guy returns and retrieves his phone, grinning.,You plaster a smile on your face. â€œCongratulations.â€,Heâ€™s glowing, face all flushed. â€œThank you.â€,You continue toward the counter, head down.,Their lives are forever changed, and youâ€™re stuck in post break-up limbo.,Nothing is changing. Nothing is new.,You look up to order. Correction: the hot barista? Thatâ€™s new.,All tattooed muscles and beanie, the guy behind the counter sticks his pen behind his ear as he enters numbers into the register.,As you approach, your eyes linger on his nametag.,Ryan. Of course, his name is Ryan.,One more addition to the long list of attractive Ryanâ€™s â€“ Ryan Gosling, Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Seacrest.,You continue to observe.,The hot barista switches his focus to organizing sugar packets. Hello?,Peripheral vision, anyone?,After a very long minute, you clear your throat.,He glances up, his dark eyes and long lashes meeting your gaze. Silence.,Oh, right. Youâ€™re supposed to order. â€œTwo daily specials, please.â€,Ryan chews on a toothpick, squinting at you.,You tilt your head. â€œWhat?â€,He shrugs. â€œYou donâ€™t strike me as a â€˜daily specialâ€™ customer.â€,Your eyes dart to the menu, which is filled with tiny print and dozens of flavor combinations.,â€œWhat does a â€˜daily specialâ€™ customer look like?â€,The toothpick tilts as the corners of Ryanâ€™s mouth lift. â€œTwo daily specials, coming up.â€ He rings up the order.,Your new nails are a hassle, but you manage to slowly unzip your purse and peer inside.,Yep. Your wallet is buried at the bottom.,You glance over at Lex, who ran into one of her sorority sisters and is happily chatting away.,This is awkward.,Maybe Ryan can help.,You lift your eyes to meet Ryanâ€™s. â€œSmall issue. I swear this has never happened before, but I just got my nails done and Iâ€™m a little scared theyâ€™ll break if I dig through my purse. Would you mind?â€,You pass him your bag.,He raises an eyebrow, sticking his hand in the purse and detangling your wallet from your lanyard.,Pausing to shoot you another look, he retrieves your credit card and swipes it on the machine, never breaking eye contact.,Returning the card to the wallet and the wallet to the purse, he passes it back.,Still maintaining your gaze, he retrieves the receipt as it prints.,You blink, rubbing your cheek with the back of your hand.,Is there still chalk on your face? Why is he staring?,Ryan finally averts his eyes, chuckling. â€œHave to say thatâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve been handed an entire purse as payment.â€,He holds out the receipt. â€œReceipt?â€,You go to grab it but you both come at the exact wrong angle and one of your new nails scratches his hand.,A small pool of blood forms and he yanks his hand back.,Disaster. Youâ€™re beyond mortified.,You try to tip him.,Maybe he can buy a first aid kit or Uber to the emergency room and forget about the messy girl who injured him at work.,You retrieve your wallet, which now rests at the top of your purse.,You manage to pull out a $20 bill, holding it out to him. â€œIâ€™m so sorry.â€,Ryan shakes his head. â€œDonâ€™t worry about it. Iâ€™ll have your drinks ready in a sec.â€,He hands you a table number and you retreat to the table Lex selected.,Lex, done with her conversation, does a double-take when she sees you.,She cranes her neck to stare at the barista. â€œI left you alone for two minutes. What happened?â€,You whimper, resting your chin on your hand and wishing you could disappear. â€œI just let that guy search through my purse and then scratched him.â€,Lex winces. â€œThat bad, huh?â€,Her eyes linger on Ryan. â€œHeâ€™s really cute.â€,You glower. â€œIâ€™m aware.â€,The table starts buzzing as a call comes through.,Lex picks up her phone and answers. â€œHello?â€ A pause. â€œOne moment.â€ She holds the phone to her chest.,â€œItâ€™s one of the girls on my Marketing project team. I hate to do this, but I have to run back to my house and get our PowerPoint submitted in the next thirty minutes or else we get a 10% grade reduction.â€,She glances at her watch. â€œYou should drop by in an hour. Does that sound okay?â€,You grimace.,â€œDoes that sound okay? Iâ€™m literally melting into a puddle of sadness on a day thatâ€™s supposed to mark the end of my existence as a sadness puddle.â€,Lex blinks. â€œYouâ€™re right. Itâ€™s only 10%.â€,Great. Now you feel like a massive jerk. â€œGo. Itâ€™s not fair to your team for me to hog you.â€,Lex squeezes your hand and throws you one more concerned look before running out of the cafÃ©.,As she disappears around the corner, Ryan approaches with two drinks. â€œTwo daily specials, on me.â€,He sets them down on the table. One has a smiley face in the foam.,You smile at it, touched. â€œThatâ€™s so nice of you. Thank you. And again, I am just so sorry. Iâ€™m never getting another manicure for the rest of my life.â€,Ryan wipes his hands on his apron. â€œAgain, I really donâ€™t mind. Iâ€™ve been scratched, kicked, and shoved around much worse during my years of soccer.â€,An athlete. Of course. You take a shaky breath. â€œIâ€™ve had a pretty bad day. And week. And month.â€,You lift the smiley face coffee to your lips and sip.,A warm rush of cinnamon slides down your throat.,"You said you play soccer?",â€œI do.â€ You take another sip. â€œMe too. I mean, I played through high school. Havenâ€™t had time since starting college.â€,Ryan retrieves a rag from his apron and brushes a few crumbs off the table. â€œThatâ€™s too bad. You should try to make it to a game, sometime. Weâ€™re only D3, but we still kick butt.â€,You tilt your head. Did the hot barista just invite you to a soccer game?,â€œYeah, for sure.â€,The door dings, indicating that a new customer has entered.,Ryan glances up. â€œLet me know if you need anything else.â€,He returns to the counter and waves them forward.,You stare out the window for the next hour, losing yourself in your thoughts until an alarm goes off and reminds you to head to Lexâ€™s place.,On the way out, you pass Ryan, whoâ€™s busy managing a large group that just entered.,Maybe the cafÃ© isnâ€™t so bad without Adam there.,You start down Washington Avenue.,You disrupt a 30-person Starbucks line that snakes out the shop door.,As you pass mannequins in flowy skirts inside a store window, you almost step on a squirrel trying to bury an acorn in a sidewalk crack.,Lex lives in a three-story sorority house a few blocks from your apartment.,Towering Greek letters loom over the entrance.,You duck under strands of ivy as you knock on the door.,To your relief, Lex answers.,Her eyes flit across your face and she welcomes you in, reading the situation wordlessly.,You enter her room, which is filled with plants and succulents of various sizes.,A bouquet of wildflowers she collected from her last hike fills a clear vase on her desk.,She pulls out her chair and pats the back, bending down to retrieve her cosmetics collection from a bottom drawer.,You sit, pulling your hair into a ponytail.,Lexâ€™s solution to heartache? Five layers of makeup, a tight dress and a frat party.,In the next hour, Lex applies thirty products youâ€™ve never heard of while issuing directions in a pattern of tilting your head, relaxing your forehead, and closing your eyes.,Finally, Lex makes a fish face and you mimic her.,She brushes a final swipe of makeup onto your cheeks and grins, stepping back.,You smile in the mirror. â€œI have cheekbones.â€,She laughs, hugging you from behind. â€œI know. Iâ€™m a miracle-worker.â€,She touches up her own lip gloss. â€œYouâ€™re going to be okay. Okay? Iâ€™m taking you to a house full of fraternity snobs.,Youâ€™ll forget all about stupid exes and injured baristas.â€,Lex tosses a clean dress at you, grabs a clutch and starts out the door. â€œMeet you in the car.â€,You roll your eyes, getting dressed. What would you do without her?,As soon as you enter the party, you note the classic sticky floor, active game of beer pong and clusters of sweaty dancers.,Lex screams, throwing her arm around a group of her sorority sisters.,One girl breaks away from the cluster and skips over to you.,Youâ€™ve seen her at one or two parties.,She points at you, grinning. â€œYouâ€™re Adamâ€™s girlfriend.â€,Your throat catches. â€œEx.â€,â€œOh.â€ Her eyes twinkle. â€œI know a secret.â€ She leans closer.,The smell of beer shoots up your nose. â€œDo you want to know?â€,Tell me.,Her gaze darts across the room. â€œLex never thought you were good together.â€,She giggles. â€œI shouldnâ€™t have said that.â€,She waves at a friend and disappears into the crowd.,You search for Lex, who is already engrossed in a game of Charades in the next room.,Crossing your arms, you melt into the background and peer over the shoulder of an onlooker.,A frat guy holds up a dry erase marker. â€œAlright, Iâ€™m looking for a volunteer brave enough to take on Lex, the Master of Charades herself.â€,You start to turn away.,He points at you, gesturing with the marker. â€œWho better than Lexâ€™s best friend? Come on up.â€,The crowd parts and you step up to the deck of cards.,Selecting one, you scoff.,Your prompt is a snake. The irony.,You draw a messy squiggle with a forked tongue on the wall theyâ€™ve sacrificed for the game.,Lex snaps her fingers. â€œSnake.â€,You confirm and the crowd cheers with excessive enthusiasm.,â€œYes, sheâ€™s wonderful.â€,You tug at Lexâ€™s arm, pulling her back to the lobby.,Lex pokes your nose. â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€,You bite your lip, trying to piece together a coherent string of words. â€œDid you approve of my relationship with Adam?â€,Lex coughs, teasing her hair. â€œWhat kind of question is that?â€,Your cheeks are hot. â€œDid you?â€,She clears her throat. â€œNo.â€,A pause. â€œI thought you deserved better.â€,Another pause. â€œYou know who I do like for you?â€,She scans the room and points at the balcony, winking at you.,You smile, giving her a hug before you turn to the balcony and spot a familiar head of messy curls.,Ryan from Firefly CafÃ©. He sports a polo shirt with a popped collar, leaning against the railing with a drink in his hand.,He gazes at the sky, deep in thought.,You walk toward him.,Someone cheers loudly from the pong table, causing you to jump.,You squeak, then cover your mouth.,Great. Youâ€™re so nervous that youâ€™re squeaking.,Youâ€™ve embarrassed yourself enough for one day.,Instead of engaging with Ryan, you find a seat in the corner of the room and sit.,Red solo cups are scattered across the entire floor and on random pieces of furniture.,The table lamp next to you glows red, a cup resting on the bulb and the lampshade upside-down below it.,For a while, you just feel the vibrations of the speakers in your chest, allowing techno music to fill your mind.,Then, Ryan sits down in front of you. â€œFancy seeing you here.â€,His head of messy curls looks as handsome as it did when paired with an apron at the cafÃ©.,You play with the seam of your dress. â€œSame to you. Is this your house?â€,He nods. â€œWhen Iâ€™m not cleaning up coffee spills at the Firefly, Iâ€™m cleaning up alcohol spills at the house. Living the dream.â€,He takes a sip of his drink.,You notice the tattoo on his wrist for the first time.,You recognize the symbol from an article you did on the schoolâ€™s archeological museum. â€œViking Compass. Solid pick. Guidance through the unknown.â€,Ryan raises an eyebrow. â€œImpressive. Not exactly a dinner table fact. Archeology major?â€,â€œJournalism. Itâ€™s my job to know the random facts.â€,From there, itâ€™s like time pauses to listen to your conversation.,You learn about Ryanâ€™s kid sister and her adventures with braces, Ryanâ€™s dream home in the Arizona desert, his platinum molar from sledding into his elementary school seesaw when he was seven.,In three hours, he transforms from a hot barista into the guy whoâ€™s afraid of needles but loves symbolism, thinks the weathermen are TVâ€™s branch of the Illuminati, and dimples at your worst jokes.,For three hours, you remember what it feels like to have temporary abs from laughter.,A comfortable lull hits.,You both try to break the silence at the same time.,Ryan nods at you. â€œSorry, you go ahead.â€,â€œWow, what a gentleman.â€,He shrugs. â€œI try.â€,You stand as a slow song plays over the speakers. â€œCare for a dance?â€,He smiles, accepting your invitation.,Because itâ€™s a packed room, thereâ€™s not much space to move, so you just hug his shoulders as he rests his hands on your waist.,This past month, youâ€™ve barely moved from bed to attend your classes.,After they finish, you would retreat to bed and continue sleeping.,Youâ€™d almost forgotten how it felt to talk to someone in a non-academic setting, let alone spend time with a guy.,You rest your head on his chest, closing your eyes.,Each song fades into the next as the two of you continue to sway like youâ€™re not standing in the middle of a frat party.,You sense it getting late and glance around the room to see a drunk Lex passed out on the couch.,You pull away and nod in Lexâ€™s direction. â€œI should get my friend out of here.â€,Ryan's smile wavers a little.,He turns to look at her. â€œSure. Need help?â€,You shrug. â€œThat would be great, thank you.â€,After your experiences with Adam, itâ€™s strange for a guy to be so proactive about helping.,At some point in the relationship, he stopped trying to be a gentleman.,Maybe there was more wrong than you had thought.,Ryan helps you walk Lex back to her car.,You buckle her into the passengerâ€™s seat and turn back to Ryan.,The dim lighting casts flattering shadows on his relaxed face.,You should give him your number.,â€œCan you grab my pen?â€ He lets out a laugh and accepts your purse, retrieving your purple pen.,You write your number on his wrist. â€œLet me know if you need help with the clean-up team tomorrow. Itâ€™s the least I could do after injuring you.â€,Ryan examines his hand.,â€œI might just take you up on that offer. Good night, Emily.â€,Waving, you duck into the car and drive back to your apartment.,You help Lex into the elevator and lay her down on your living room couch.,Throwing a blanket over her, you enter your bedroom and shut the door.,You slide open your closet.,Standing on your tiptoes, you retrieve a box from the top shelf.,You set it down on your bed and peer inside.,Movie ticket stubs, anniversary cards, souvenirs from your trips to New York, and band tees from various stadium tours stare back at you.,Time is strange, isnâ€™t it?,Two years of happiness reduced to a pile of paper and polyester in a duct-taped box.,You glance at the clock. Eleven fifty-five.,Five minutes until your cheat day is over and you really need to move on with your life.,You sit cross-legged on your fluffy rug, hugging the box to your chest.,Relationships are beautiful.,Theyâ€™re starry nights and jealous tears.,Theyâ€™re intertwined hands and heads on shoulders at movie theaters, blocking the vision of the annoying kid kicking the back of your seat.,Theyâ€™re messy buns and pizza stains on Friday nights spent watching Harry Potter movie marathons.,And for each beautiful memory, each precious moment, you trade a little piece of yourself.,You canâ€™t unsee the stars, un-cry the tears, forget how good it felt to hold onto someone stable and strong and vulnerable.,And no matter how hard you squeeze your eyes shut and click your heels together, youâ€™ll never be the same exact person you were a relationship ago.,At the end of the day, youâ€™re left with a box of memories and a choice:,you either let go of that part of you that isnâ€™t yours anymore, or you hold onto the sadness and close your heart to a new shot at happiness.,The clock reads eleven fifty-nine.,You brush a handful of stray tears from your wet cheek with the back of your hand and stand.,You throw the box away.,That's that. You blink hard, unsure what to do next.,You move to the window to pull the blinds shut.,A strong aroma enters the room, overwhelming your senses.,You turn and scan the bed, the pillows, the closet.,Why does it smell like coffee?,A familiar alarm tone sounds.,At first, itâ€™s distant. It grows louder and nearer each second.,You sit up, clutching a handful of blankets in one hand and your stuffed bear in the other.,The sudden movement startles Adam, who is seated at your desk.,A coffee mug rests in his grip. â€œBad dream?â€ he asks, brows knitted.,He takes a sip of his drink and sets it down.,You rub your eyes, blinking fast at Adam. You resist the urge to pinch yourself.,He sits beside you and kisses your cheek, smiling and brushing the hair from your face. â€œHappy two-year anniversary, babe.â€,Your heart pounds. It was all a dream.,Your nose burns as you struggle to suppress the silent tears forming in your eyes--that was the most realistic dream you've ever had.,You lean forward and hug hum, chin resting on his shoulder. â€œHappy anniversary, Adam.â€,The End.
